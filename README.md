# lpass_dmenu

After moving from pass unix, i sorely missed the ability to access my passwords from outside the browser.

Hence, I have written this small script.

Note that this program expects an environment variable of lpass_username to be set.

Additionally, this script actually uses rofi instead of dmenu. But dmenu could be easily switched in by replacing the instances of rofi.
